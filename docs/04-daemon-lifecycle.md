# Daemon lifecycle

Use these commands:

```sh
ours-cowork start
ours-cowork status
ours-cowork restart
ours-cowork stop
ours-cowork serve
```

`start` detaches the standalone CLI in `serve` mode and waits for the authenticated control session on `management.sock`. `serve` keeps the supervisor in the foreground. Status asks the responding worker to prove that its supervisor capability handshake completed. Stop sends a session-bound shutdown request to that worker; the worker asks its own supervisor over their existing authenticated IPC channel to enter the same bounded shutdown path used for signals. The CLI never signals a numeric PID. Stop reports success only after the accepted control session disappears. An occupied socket without this protocol blocks stop/restart with invalid state and is left untouched.

Exit codes are stable: `0` success, `2` CLI usage, `3` not found, `4` invalid state or parameters, `5` unauthorized, `6` daemon unavailable, and `7` internal failure. With `--json`, stdout contains exactly one JSON value and stderr stays empty. This includes foreground `serve`: supervised worker output is suppressed, and its clean or failed terminal status becomes that one JSON result.
